* legislators.csv: contains information on each legislator, including their name, ID, party affiliation, and state.
* votes.csv: contains information on each vote, including the bill ID, the legislator ID, and their vote choice (yes, no, present, etc.).
* vote_results.csv: contains information on the outcome of each vote, including the bill ID, the number of yes, no, and present votes, and whether the bill passed or failed.

# Technologies
* Python: a high-level programming language used for data analysis, machine learning, and web development.
* pandas: a library that provides data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language, specifically designed for working with tabular and heterogeneous data.
* NumPy: a library for the Python programming language that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
